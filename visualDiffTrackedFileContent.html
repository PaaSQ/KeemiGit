Vim (an acronym for Vi IMproved) is a text editor written by Bram Moolenaar and first released publicly in 1991. Based on the vi editor common to Unix-like systems, Vim is designed for use both from a command line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. 

2. Vim is free and open source software and is released under a license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda.

3. Although Vim was originally released for the Amiga, Vim has since been developed to be cross-platform, supporting many other platforms. In 2006, it was voted the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal readers.

4. The name &quot;Vim&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Vi IMproved&quot;[6] because Vim is an extended version of the vi editor, with many additional features designed to be helpful in editing program source code.
